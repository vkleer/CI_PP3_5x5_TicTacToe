### User Manual
<details><summary>Click here for the user manual</summary>

#### Log in menu
When users start the program, they land on the 'Log in' menu. Above the menu, and on every other 'page' of the program except for the actual game, an ASCII logo of the game is shown. Below the logo the user is presented with three options.
Operation: Input a numeric value and press the enter key.
1. Log in
2. Create new account
3. Quit game

If the user at any point in the program or game enters a value that does not correspond to the options available, they will receive feedback of what they entered and are reminded of the available options. They will then be able to provide input again until a valid option has been chosen.

#### Log in
If option 1 is selected from the 'Log in' menu, the users will be asked to enter the email addresses they used to create an account. It will first ask player 1 to enter their email address and the player 2. It doesn't matter who logs in first as a random player will get the first turn each game.

Each email address is validated, first by checking if it follows the format of 'name@example.com' and second by looking up the email address in the database (Google Sheets file). 
If the email address doesn't follow the correct format, users will be given feedback, e.g. 'It must have exactly one @-sign'. If they enter the correct format but the email address is not registered, they will be presented with two options.
Operation: Input a numeric value and press the enter key.
1. Try different email address
2. Create new account

If option 1 is selected, the log in process is repeated. If option 2 is chosen, users will be able to create a new account.

If the log in was successful, the users will be taken to the 'Main' menu.

#### Create new account
If option 2 is selected in either the 'Log in' menu or after a failed log in, users will be able to create a new account.

The first user, player 1, will be asked to provide a username for their account, which is validated: The username has to be between 2 to 20 characters long can only contain letters and digits - no special characters are allowed. After the validation, the username will be compared to the existing usernames in the database (Google Sheets file) and if a match is found, the player will be informed and has to provide a new username.

Then, player 1 will be asked to provide an email address for their account, which is also validated: the emaill address has to follow the format of 'name@example.com'. After the validation, the email address will be compared to the existing email addresses in the database (Google Sheets file) and if a match is found, the player will be informed and has to provide a new email address.

After player 1 has created their account, the second user, player 2, will be presented with two options.
Operation: Input a numeric value and press the enter key.
1. Create new account
2. Already have an account, go to log in menu

If option 1 is selected, player 2 will go through the same process as player 1 did, except that the player will be taken to the 'Log in' menu after their account is created. If option 2 is selected, they will be taken to the log in menu.

#### Main menu
After player 1 and player 2 have logged in they land on the 'Main' menu. Here they will be presented with four options.
Operation: Input a numeric value and press the enter key.
1. Start the game
2. Read game instructions
3. View win count
4. Log out

#### Game instructions
If option 2 is selected, the game instructions will be displayed. The players will be shown the Tic-Tac-Toe grid and explained how to place a mark down on the grid. After the instructions have been displayed, they will be taken back to the 'Main' menu.
Operation: Input any key and press the enter key.

#### View win count
If option 3 is selected from the 'Main' menu, the win count of both players will be displayed. The players will then return to the 'Main' menu.
Operation: Input any key and press the enter key.

#### Game
If option 1 is selected from the 'Main' or 'Play again' menu, the players will be taken to the game. As mentioned before, a random player will be picked to have the first turn at the start of each game. 

The player will be asked to select a row number, ranging from 1 to 5. Once a row number is selected, the player will be asked to select a column letter, ranging from A to E. The selected position will then be validated to see if the position is empty or if another mark is already in place. If there is another mark in place, the player will be informed about this and prompted to select a new row number and column letter. If the position is empty, the mark will be placed and the players' turn ends. Now the other player will be able to place a mark on the grid.

if the player provides invalid input, like entering a string as the row number, the player will receive feedback of what they've entered and informed what they did wrong. They will then be able to provide input again until a valid option has been chosen. 

The game ends when one of the players has placed 4 consecutive, uninterrupted marks in a row, column or diagonal. Since the game has a 5x5 grid, there are multiple ways to achieve this. A message will be displayed to inform the players who won, displaying the winners' updated total amount of wins. The game then ends.

If neither players are able to secure a win before the grid is full, a message will be displayed to inform the players that the game is a tie. The game then ends.

After the game has ended, the players will be brought to the 'Play again' menu.
Operation: Input any key and press the enter key.

#### Play again menu
After a game has ended, no matter the outcome, players will land on the 'Play again' menu. Here they will be presented with three options.
Operation: Input a numeric value and press the enter key.
1. Play again
2. Main menu
3. Log out
4. Quit game

#### Log out
If option 4 is selected on the 'Main' menu or option 3 on the 'Play again' menu, the players will be logged out and taken to the 'Log in' menu.

#### Quit game
If option 3 is selected on the 'log in' menu or option 4 on the 'Play again' menu, a thank you message will be printed and the program will exit.

## Technologies Used

### Languages
- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/)

### Tools
- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) was used for version control
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) was used as a remote repository to store the all project files
- [**Gitpod**](https://gitpod.io/) was used as the IDE to write the project code
- [**Google Cloud**](https://console.cloud.google.com/) was used to manage access to the Google Sheets and Google Drive API's using a service account key
- [**Google Sheets**](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) was used to store the players' account details
- [**Heroku**](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) was used to deploy the project
- [**PEP8**](http://pep8online.com/) was used to validate my Python code
- [**LucidChart**](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) was used to create the flowchart

### Libraries

#### Built-in Python Libraries
- **os** is used to clear the terminal 
- **sys** is used to to exit the program
- **random** is used to change from player 1 to player 2 and vice versa
- [**unittest**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) is used to create automated tests for player_validation.py
- [**patch**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.patch) from [**unittest.mock**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html) is used to to test my register_players and log_in functions from player_validation.py, which both require multiple inputs in a row to complete the test

#### Third Party Libraries
- [**gpread**](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/) is used to get, set and delete data in my Google Sheets file. The Google Sheets file contains the usernames, email addresses and win counts for each player that has registered.
- [**Credentials**](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/reference/google.oauth2.credentials.html?highlight=credentials) from [**google.oauth2.service_account**](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/) is used for the authentification that's required to connect to my Google service account to the Google Drive and Google Sheets API. A service account key has been created in JSON with the name creds.json. The connection is set up in player_validation.py. To keep the creds.json file safe, it is put in the .gitignore file to prevent it from being pushed to GitHub. As the project is deployed on Heroku, the contents of the creds.json file have been stored in a Config Var inside the Heroku application settings to make the connection work.
- [**email_validator**](https://pypi.org/project/email-validator/) is used to validate the players' email address when entered on registration and log in. It must follow the format of 'name@example.com'.

### Automated Testing
To challenge myself, I decided to incorporate automated testing into my project. I used the built-in unittest and unittest.mock libraries to achieve this. I tested multiple seperate functions.

#### Testing the validate_player_username and validate_player_email functions
The validate_player_username and validate_player_email functions inside my player_validation.py file do exactly what their names suggest: they take a username or email address as an argument and return **True** if the format is valid. To test these I wrote a couple of simple unit tests by providing both valid and invalid input. 

If the test input is supposed to be valid, **assertTrue** is used, returning **True** in the statement - if the input was supposed to be invalid, **assertEqual** was used, returning **None** in the statement

<details><summary>Screenshot of validate_player_username and validate_player_email unit testing code</summary>
    <img src="docs/testing/unit-test-input-validation-functions.JPG">
</details>

#### Testing the log_in and register_players functions
The log_in function and register_players function inside my player_validation.py file required a more advanced method to be tested, since they both require multiple user inputs. This took me a while to get right, but in the end I solved it by importing **patch** from the **unittest.mock** library. 

A patch decorator is used to access the built-in input function. The unit test is then declared, taking two parameters: self and mocked_input. The mocked_input is a **Mock** object - the side_effect function is called on this object, taking several string arguments. These arguments are iterated through when the unit test is called, providing input until the function has completed. 
Both functions use the same technique. 

<details><summary>Screenshot of log_in and register_players unit testing code</summary>
    <img src="docs/testing/unit-test-input-validation-functions.JPG">
</details>
<details><summary>GIF of the unit tests being run</summary>
    <img src="docs/testing/unit-testing.gif">
</details>

Since both functions don't return a value on completion, **assertEqual** is used, returning **None** in the statement.

The register_players function asks player 1 for a username, then a username confirmation, then an email address, then an email address confirmation. It will then ask player 2 if they want to create an account as well or if they want to go to the login page. In the unit test I decided to create two test accounts.

The log_in function asks for two email addresses to log in the players. After the test accounts have successfully logged in, the accounts are deleted using the delete_test_data function in my player_validation.py file.

## Bugs

- The [git template IDE](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) from Code Institute
- The connection to my Google Sheets file was implemented using the 'Love Sandwiches Walkthrough Project' by Code institute
- Not exactly code, but the game logo in ASCII characters was created using the [Text to ASCII Art Generator](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/) by [Patrick Gillespie](https://patorjk.com/)
- The clear_screen function was implemented using a solution on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2084508/clear-terminal-in-python) solution by user [Vasiliy Rusin](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5004246/vasiliy-rusin). It's not complicated, but I liked how simple the solution was
- The Python Reference on the [ord() function](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_ord.asp) by [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) helped me understand how to convert column letters into integers
- To convert the integers from the ord() function into integers from 0 to 4, [this ASCII table](https://theasciicode.com.ar/) helped me to calculate the difference
- I learned how to rotate a list of lists by 90 degrees by following a solution on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34347043/how-can-i-rotate-this-list-of-lists-with-python/34347121#34347121) by user [Padraic Cunningham](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2141635/padraic-cunningham), which saved me a couple of lines of code in my check_for_win method in my Grid class, found in my run.py file
- I learned how to stop Python from running the main function after importing a module using a solution on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6523791/why-is-python-running-my-module-when-i-import-it-and-how-do-i-stop-it) by anonymous user user166390
- The [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) and [unittest.mock](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.htm) library documentation from the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/) helped me understand how to use the libraries for my automated testing
